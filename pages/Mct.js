                    <p>These Ex cable and pipe transits are used in high-risk maritime, offshore and land-based environments to minimize danger by preventing the spread of fire, water, gas, chemicals and other hazards substances.</p>
                    <p>The system consists of a round rubber frame (RGP Ex) and rubber blocks. The RGP Ex is assembled in sleeves, pipes, drilled or cast holes and packed with rubber blocks suited for each cable and pipe dimension. The compression bolts are tightened to compress the rubber blocks against cables and pipes to establish a tight seal.</p>
